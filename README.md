# Parallax-Effect
The parallax effect in web design creates a dynamic and engaging user experience by making background images move more slowly than foreground images as you scroll. This technique adds depth and a sense of three-dimensional space to a webpage, making it visually appealing and interactive. It can be used to enhance storytelling, create striking landing pages, and highlight products in an attractive way.
